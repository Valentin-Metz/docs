## Official Binaries

### Stable Releases

You can download the latest stable release versions of rustic from the
`rustic release page <https://github.com/rustic/rustic/releases/latest>`__.
These builds are considered stable and releases are made regularly in a
controlled manner.

There's both pre-compiled binaries for different platforms as well as the source
code available for download. Just download and run the one matching your system.

Once downloaded, the official binaries can be updated in place using the
`rustic self-update` command (needs rustic 0.3.1 or later):

```console
$ rustic  self-update
Checking target-arch... x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
Checking current version... v0.3.0-dev
Checking latest released version... v0.3.1
New release found! v0.3.0-dev --> v0.3.1
New release is *NOT* compatible

rustic release status:
    * Current exe: "/usr/local/bin/rustic"
    * New exe release: "rustic-v0.3.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz"
    * New exe download url: "https://api.github.com/repos/rustic/rustic/releases/assets/75146490"

The new release will be downloaded/extracted and the existing binary will be replaced.

```

**Note**: Please be aware that the user executing the `rustic self-update`
command must have the permission to replace the rustic binary.

### Unstable Builds

Another option is to use the latest builds for the master branch, available on
the `rustic beta download site <https://github.com/rustic-rs/rustic-beta>`__.
These too are pre-compiled and ready to run, and a new version is built every
time a push is made to the main branch.

## From Source

---

rustic is written in Rust and you need a current Rust version.

In order to build rustic from source, execute the following steps:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/rustic-rs/rustic
[...]
$ cd rustic
$ cargo build --release
```

You can easily cross-compile rustic for all supported platforms, make sure that
the cross-compile toolchain is installed for your target. Then run the build for
your chosen target like this

```console
cargo build --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu --release
```

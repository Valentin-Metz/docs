The place where your backups will be saved is called a "repository". This
chapter explains how to create ("init") such a repository. The repository can be
stored locally, or on some remote server or service. We'll first cover using a
local repository; the remaining sections of this chapter cover all the other
options. You can skip to the next chapter once you've read the relevant section
here.

For automated backups, rustic accepts the repository location in the environment
variable `RUSTIC_REPOSITORY`.

For the password, several options exist:

- Setting the environment variable `RUSTIC_PASSWORD`

- Specifying the path to a file with the password via the option
  `--password-file` or the environment variable `RUSTIC_PASSWORD_FILE`

- Configuring a program to be called when the password is needed via the option
  `--password-command` or the environment variable `RUSTIC_PASSWORD_COMMAND`

The `init` command has an option called `--set-version` which can be used to
explicitly set the version for the new repository.

The below table shows which rustic version is required to use a certain
repository version and shows new features introduced by the repository format.

| Repository version | Minimum rustic version | Major new features  |
| :----------------: | :--------------------: | :-----------------: |
|        `1`         |      any version       |                     |
|        `2`         |        >=0.2.0         | Compression support |

Moreover, there are different options which can be set when initializing a
repository:

Options to specify the target pack size:

- `--set-treepack-size`, `--set-datapack-size` specify the default target pack
  size for tree and data pack files. Arguments can given using TODO For example,
  valid sizes are "4048kiB", "2MB", "30MiB", etc. If not specified, the default
  is 4 MiB for tree packs and 32 MiB for data packs.

- `--set-treepack-growfactor`, `--set-datapack-growfactor` specify how much the
  target pack size should be increased per square root of the total pack size in
  bytes of the given type. This equals to 32kiB per square root of the total
  pack size in GiB.

Note that larger pack sizes have advantages, especially for large repository or
remote repositories. They lead to less packs in the repository and transfer
larger datasets to the repository which can increase the throughput. But there
are also disadvantages. Rustic keeps the whole pack in memory before writing it
to the backend. As writes are parallelized, multiple packs are kept. So larger
pack sizes increase the memory usage of the `backup` command. Moreover larger
pack sizes lead to increased repack rates during `prune` or `forget -- prune`.

## Backends

### Local

In order to create a repository at `/srv/rustic-repo`, run the following command
and enter the same password twice:

```console
$ rustic init -r /srv/rustic-repo
enter password for new repository:
created rustic repository 085b3c76b9 at /srv/rustic-repo
```

**Warning**: Remembering your password is important! If you lose it, you won't
be able to access data stored in the repository.

**Warning**: On Linux, storing the backup repository on a CIFS (SMB) share is
not recommended due to compatibility issues. Either use another backend or set
the environment variable `GODEBUG` to `asyncpreemptoff=1`. Refer to GitHub issue
`#2659 <https://github.com/rustic/rustic/issues/2659>`_ for further
explanations.

### REST Server

In order to backup data to the remote server via HTTP or HTTPS protocol, you
must first set up a remote
`REST server <https://github.com/rustic/rest-server>`__ instance. Once the
server is configured, accessing it is achieved by changing the URL scheme like
this:

```console
rustic -r rest:http://host:8000/ init
```

Depending on your REST server setup, you can use HTTPS protocol, password
protection, multiple repositories or any combination of those features. The
TCP/IP port is also configurable. Here are some more examples:

```console
rustic -r rest:https://host:8000/ init
rustic -r rest:https://user:pass@host:8000/ init
rustic -r rest:https://user:pass@host:8000/my_backup_repo/ init
```

If you use TLS, rustic will use the system's CA certificates to verify the
server certificate. When the verification fails, rustic refuses to proceed and
exits with an error. If you have your own self-signed certificate, or a custom
CA certificate should be used for verification, you can pass rustic the
certificate filename via the `--cacert` option. It will then verify that the
server's certificate is contained in the file passed to this option, or signed
by a CA certificate in the file. In this case, the system CA certificates are
not considered at all.

REST server uses exactly the same directory structure as local backend, so you
should be able to access it both locally and via HTTP, even simultaneously.

### Other Services via rclone

The program `rclone` *can be used to access many other different services and
store data there. First, you need to install and `configure`* rclone. The
general backend specification format is `rclone:<remote>:<path>`, the
`<remote>:<path>` component will be directly passed to rclone. When you
configure a remote named `foo`, you can then call rustic as follows to initiate
a new repository in the path `bar` in the repo:

```console
rustic -r rclone:foo:bar init
```

rustic takes care of starting and stopping rclone.

As a more concrete example, suppose you have configured a remote named `b2prod`
for Backblaze B2 with rclone, with a bucket called `yggdrasil`. You can then use
rclone to list files in the bucket like this:

```console
rclone ls b2prod:yggdrasil
```

In order to create a new repository in the root directory of the bucket, call
rustic like this:

```console
rustic -r rclone:b2prod:yggdrasil init
```

If you want to use the path `foo/bar/baz` in the bucket instead, pass this to
rustic:

```console
rustic -r rclone:b2prod:yggdrasil/foo/bar/baz init
```

Listing the files of an empty repository directly with rclone should return a
listing similar to the following:

```console
$ rclone ls b2prod:yggdrasil/foo/bar/baz
    155 bar/baz/config
    448 bar/baz/keys/4bf9c78049de689d73a56ed0546f83b8416795295cda12ec7fb9465af3900b44
```

Rclone can be `configured with environment variables`_, so for instance
configuring a bandwidth limit for rclone can be achieved by setting the
`RCLONE_BWLIMIT` environment variable:

```console
export RCLONE_BWLIMIT=1M
```

For debugging rclone, you can set the environment variable `RCLONE_VERBOSE=2`.

## Cold storage

Rustic supports to store the repository in a so-called cold storage. These are
storages which are design for long-time storage and offer usually cheap storage
for the price of retarded or expensive access. Examples are Amazon S3 Glacier or
OVH Cloud Archive.

To use a cold storage and not access any data in the storage for every-day
operations, rustic needs an extra repository to store hot data. This repository
can be specified by the `--hot-repo` option or the `RUSTIC_REPO_HOT`
environmental variable, e.g.:

```console
rustic -r rclone:foo:bar --repo-hot rclone:foo:bar init
```

In this example in the repository
``rclone:foo:bar``` all data is saved. In the repository``rclone:foo:bar-hot``
only hot data is saved, i.e. this is not a complete repository.

**Warning**: You have to specify both the cold repository (using `-r`) and the
hot repository (using `--repo-hot`) in the `init` command and all other commands
which access and work with the repository.

## Configuration file

Rustic supports configuration files in the TOML format which should be located
in the rustic config dir. On unix this is typically `$HOME/.config/rustic`, see
<https://docs.rs/directories/latest/directories/struct.ProjectDirs.html> for
more details about the config location. If no rustic config dir is available,
rustic searches the current working dir for configuration files.

By default, rustic uses the file `rustic.toml`. This can be overwritten by the
`-P <PROFILE>` option which tells rustic to search for a `<PROFILE>.toml`
configuration file. For example, if you have a `local.toml` configuration for
backing up to a local dir and a `remote.toml` configuration for a remote
storage, you can use `rustic -P local <COMMAND>` and
`rustic -P remote <COMMAND>`, respectively to switch between you two backup
configurations.

Note that options in the config file can always be overwritten by ENV

In the configuration file, you can specify all global and repository-specific
options as well as options/sources for the `backup` command and `forget`
options. Using a config file like

```toml
# rustic config file to backup /home and /etc to a local repository

[repository]
repository = "/backup/rustic"
password-file = "/root/key-rustic"
no-cache = true # no cache needed for local repository

[forget]
keep-daily = 14 keep-weekly = 5

[backup]
exclude-if-present = [".nobackup", "CACHEDIR.TAG"]
glob-file = ["/root/rustic-local.glob"]

[[backup.sources]]
source = "/home"
git-ignore = true

[[backup.sources]]
source = "/etc"
```

allows you to use `rustic backup` and `rustic forget --prune` in your regularly
backup/cleanup scripts.

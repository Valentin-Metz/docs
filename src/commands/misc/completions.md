All completion files are generated by invoking `rustic completions` command. So
run:

## Bash

```sh
rustic completions bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/rustic.bash
```

## Fish

```sh
rustic completions fish > $HOME/.config/fish/completions/rustic.fish
```

## Powershell

### Linux

```sh
rustic completions powershell >> ~/.config/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1.
```

### Windows

```sh
rustic completions powershell >> $HOME\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1.
```

### macOs

```sh
rustic completions powershell >> ~/.config/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
```

## Zsh

ZSH completions are commonly stored in any directory listed in your `$fpath`
variable. To use these completions, write completions script (`_rustic`) to one
of those directories, or add your own to this list.

This list includes, for example, these directories:

- `/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions`
- `/usr/share/zsh/site-functions`

So you can run:

```sh
rustic completions zsh > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_rustic
```

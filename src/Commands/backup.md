## Preparing a new repository

The place where your backups will be saved is called a "repository". This
chapter explains how to create ("init") such a repository. The repository can be
stored locally, or on some remote server or service. We'll first cover using a
local repository; the remaining sections of this chapter cover all the other
options. You can skip to the next chapter once you've read the relevant section
here.

For automated backups, rustic accepts the repository location in the environment
variable `RUSTIC_REPOSITORY`.

For the password, several options exist:

- Setting the environment variable `RUSTIC_PASSWORD`

- Specifying the path to a file with the password via the option
  `--password-file` or the environment variable `RUSTIC_PASSWORD_FILE`

- Configuring a program to be called when the password is needed via the option
  `--password-command` or the environment variable `RUSTIC_PASSWORD_COMMAND`

The `init` command has an option called `--set-version` which can be used to
explicitly set the version for the new repository.

The below table shows which rustic version is required to use a certain
repository version and shows new features introduced by the repository format.

## | Repository version | Minimum rustic version | Major new features | |

Now we're ready to backup some data. The contents of a directory at a specific
point in time is called a "snapshot" in rustic. Run the following command and
enter the repository password you chose above again:

```console
$ rustic -r /srv/rustic-repo --verbose backup ~/work
open repository
enter password for repository:
password is correct
lock repository
load index files
start scan
start backup
scan finished in 1.837s
processed 1.720 GiB in 0:12
Files:        5307 new,     0 changed,     0 unmodified
Dirs:         1867 new,     0 changed,     0 unmodified
Added:      1.200 GiB
snapshot 40dc1520 saved
```

As you can see, rustic created a backup of the directory and was pretty fast!
The specific snapshot just created is identified by a sequence of hexadecimal
characters, `40dc1520` in this case.

You can see that rustic tells us it processed 1.720 GiB of data, this is the
size of the files and directories in `~/work` on the local file system. It also
tells us that only 1.200 GiB was added to the repository. This means that some
of the data was duplicate and rustic was able to efficiently reduce it.

If you don't pass the `--verbose` option, rustic will print less data. You'll
still get a nice live status display. Be aware that the live status shows the
processed files and not the transferred data. Transferred volume might be lower
(due to de-duplication) or higher.

If you run the backup command again, rustic will create another snapshot of your
data, but this time it's even faster and no new data was added to the repository
(since all data is already there). This is de-duplication at work!

```console
$ rustic -r /srv/rustic-repo --verbose backup ~/work
open repository
enter password for repository:
password is correct
lock repository
load index files
using parent snapshot d875ae93
start scan
start backup
scan finished in 1.881s
processed 1.720 GiB in 0:03
Files:           0 new,     0 changed,  5307 unmodified
Dirs:            0 new,     0 changed,  1867 unmodified
Added:      0 B
snapshot 79766175 saved
```

You can even backup individual files in the same repository (not passing
`--verbose` means less output):

```console
$ rustic -r /srv/rustic-repo backup ~/work.txt
enter password for repository:
password is correct
snapshot 249d0210 saved
```

Now is a good time to run `rustic check` to verify that all data is properly
stored in the repository. You should run this command regularly to make sure the
internal structure of the repository is free of errors.

## File change detection

When rustic encounters a file that has already been backed up, whether in the
current backup or a previous one, it makes sure the file's contents are only
stored once in the repository. To do so, it normally has to scan the entire
contents of every file. Because this can be very expensive, rustic also uses a
change detection rule based on file metadata to determine whether a file is
likely unchanged since a previous backup. If it is, the file is not scanned
again.

Change detection is only performed for regular files (not special files,
symlinks or directories) that have the exact same path as they did in a previous
backup of the same location. If a file or one of its containing directories was
renamed, it is considered a different file and its entire contents will be
scanned again.

Metadata changes (permissions, ownership, etc.) are always included in the
backup, even if file contents are considered unchanged.

On **Unix** (including Linux and Mac), given that a file lives at the same
location as a file in a previous backup, the following file metadata attributes
have to match for its contents to be presumed unchanged:

- Modification timestamp (mtime).
- Metadata change timestamp (ctime).
- File size.
- Inode number (internal number used to reference a file in a filesystem).

The reason for requiring both mtime and ctime to match is that Unix programs can
freely change mtime (and some do). In such cases, a ctime change may be the only
hint that a file did change.

The following `rustic backup` command line flags modify the change detection
rules:

- `--force`: turn off change detection and rescan all files.
- `--ignore-ctime`: require mtime to match, but allow ctime to differ.
- `--ignore-inode`: require mtime to match, but allow inode number and ctime to
  differ.

The option `--ignore-inode` exists to support FUSE-based filesystems and pCloud,
which do not assign stable inodes to files.

Note that the device id of the containing mount point is never taken into
account. Device numbers are not stable for removable devices and ZFS snapshots.
If you want to force a re-scan in such a case, you can change the mountpoint.

## Dry Runs

You can perform a backup in dry run mode to see what would happen without
modifying the repo.

- `--dry-run`/`-n` Report what would be done, without writing to the repository

## Excluding Files

You can exclude folders and files by specifying exclude patterns, currently the
exclude options are:

- `--git-ignore` Respect `.gitignore` files and exclude paths/files not handled
  by git.
- `--glob` include/exclue files and dirs based on given glob patterns
- `--iglob` Same as `--glob` but ignores the case of paths
- `--glob-file` Specified one or more times to exclude items listed in a given
  file
- `--iglob-file` Same as `--glob-file` but ignores cases like in `--iglob`
- `--exclude-if-present foo` Specified one or more times to exclude a folder's
  content if it contains a file called `foo`. For example, to exclude cache
  dirs, specify `--exclude-if-present CACHEDIR.TAG`.
- `--exclude-larger-than size` Specified once to excludes files larger than the
  given size

Please see `rustic help backup` for more specific information about each exclude
option.

Let's say we have a file called `glob.txt` with the following content:

```text
# exclude go-files
!*.go
# exclude foo/x/y/z/bar foo/x/bar foo/bar
!foo/**/bar
```

It can be used like this:

```console
rustic -r /srv/rustic-repo backup ~/work --glob="!*.c" --glob-file=glob.txt
```

This instructs rustic to exclude files matching the following criteria:

- All files matching `*.c` (parameter `--glob`)
- All files matching `*.go` (second line in `glob.txt`)
- All files and sub-directories named `bar` which reside somewhere below a
  directory called `foo` (fourth line in `glob.txt`)

By specifying the option `--one-file-system` you can instruct rustic to only
backup files from the file systems the initially specified files or directories
reside on. In other words, it will prevent rustic from crossing filesystem
boundaries and subvolumes when performing a backup.

For example, if you backup `/` with this option and you have external media
mounted under `/media/usb` then rustic will not back up `/media/usb` at all
because this is a different filesystem than `/`. Virtual filesystems such as
`/proc` are also considered different and thereby excluded when using
`--one-file-system`:

```console
rustic -r /srv/rustic-repo backup --one-file-system /
```

Please note that this does not prevent you from specifying multiple filesystems
on the command line, e.g:

```console
rustic -r /srv/rustic-repo backup --one-file-system / /media/usb
```

will back up both the `/` and `/media/usb` filesystems, but will not include
other filesystems like `/sys` and `/proc`.

**Note**: `--one-file-system` is currently unsupported on Windows, and will
cause the backup to immediately fail with an error.

Files larger than a given size can be excluded using the `--exclude-larger-than`
option:

```console
rustic -r /srv/rustic-repo backup ~/work --exclude-larger-than 1M
```

This excludes files in `~/work` which are larger than 1 MiB from the backup.

The default unit for the size value is bytes, so e.g.
`--exclude-larger-than 2048` would exclude files larger than 2048 bytes (2 KiB).
To specify other units, suffix the size value with one of `k`/`K` for KiB (1024
bytes), `m`/`M` for MiB (1024^2 bytes), `g`/`G` for GiB (1024^3 bytes) and
`t`/`T` for TiB (1024^4 bytes), e.g. `1k`, `10K`, `20m`, `20M`, `30g`, `30G`,
`2t` or `2T`).

## Comparing Snapshots

Rustic has a `diff` command which shows the difference between two snapshots or
a snapshot and a local path/dir

```console
$ rustic -r /srv/rustic-repo diff 5845b002 2ab627a6
password is correct
comparing snapshot ea657ce5 to 2ab627a6:

    C   /rustic/cmd_diff.go
+    /rustic/foo
    C   /rustic/rustic
```

## Backing up special items and metadata

**Symlinks** are archived as symlinks, `rustic` does not follow them. When you
restore, you get the same symlink again, with the same link target and the same
timestamps.

If there is a **bind-mount** below a directory that is to be saved, rustic
descends into it.

**Device files** are saved and restored as device files. This means that e.g.
`/dev/sda` is archived as a block device file and restored as such. This also
means that the content of the corresponding disk is not read, at least not from
the device file.

By default, rustic does not save the access time (atime) for any files or other
items, since it is not possible to reliably disable updating the access time by
rustic itself. This means that for each new backup a lot of metadata is written,
and the next backup needs to write new metadata again. If you really want to
save the access time for files and directories, you can pass the `--with-atime`
option to the `backup` command.

Note that `rustic` does not back up some metadata associated with files. Of
particular note are::

- file creation date on Unix platforms
- inode flags on Unix platforms
- xattr information

## Reading data from stdin

Sometimes it can be nice to directly save the output of a program, e.g.
`mysqldump` so that the SQL can later be restored. Rustic supports this mode of
operation, just supply `-` as backup source to the `backup` command like this:

```console
set -o pipefail
mysqldump [...] | rustic backup -
```

This creates a new snapshot of the output of `mysqldump`. You can then use e.g.
the fuse mounting option (see below) to mount the repository and read the file.

By default, the file name `stdin` is used, a different name can be specified
with `--stdin-filename`, e.g. like this:

```console
mysqldump [...] | rustic --stdin-filename production.sql -
```

The option `pipefail` is highly recommended so that a non-zero exit code from
one of the programs in the pipe (e.g. `mysqldump` here) makes the whole chain
return a non-zero exit code. Refer to the
`Use the Unofficial Bash Strict Mode <http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/>`__
for more details on this.

## Tags for backup

Snapshots can have one or more tags, short strings which add identifying
information. Just specify the tags for a snapshot one by one with `--tag`:

```console
$ rustic -r /srv/rustic-repo backup --tag projectX --tag foo --tag bar ~/work
[...]
```

The tags can later be used to keep (or forget) snapshots with the `forget`
command. The command `tag` can be used to modify tags on an existing snapshot.

## Scheduling backups

Rustic does not have a built-in way of scheduling backups, as it's a tool that
runs when executed rather than a daemon. There are plenty of different ways to
schedule backup runs on various different platforms, e.g. systemd and cron on
Linux/BSD and Task Scheduler in Windows, depending on one's needs and
requirements. When scheduling rustic to run recurringly, please make sure to
detect already running instances before starting the backup.

## Space requirements

Rustic currently assumes that your backup repository has sufficient space for
the backup operation you are about to perform. This is a realistic assumption
for many cloud providers, but may not be true when backing up to local disks.

Should you run out of space during the middle of a backup, there will be some
additional data in the repository, but the snapshot will never be created as it
would only be written at the very (successful) end of the backup operation.
Previous snapshots will still be there and will still work.

## Environment Variables

In addition to command-line options, rustic supports passing various options in
environment variables. The following lists these environment variables:

```console
RUSTIC_REPOSITORY                   Location of repository (replaces -r)
RUSTIC_REPO_HOT                     Location of hot repository (replaces -repo-hot)
RUSTIC_PASSWORD                     The actual password for the repository (replaces --password)
RUSTIC_PASSWORD_FILE                Location of password file (replaces --password-file)
RUSTIC_PASSWORD_COMMAND             Command printing the password for the repository to stdout (replaces --password-command)
RUSTIC_CACHE_DIR                    Location of the cache directory (replaces --cache-dir)
RUSTIC_NO_CACHE                     Use no cache (replaces --no-cache)
```

rustic may execute `rclone` (for rclone backends) which may respond to further
environment variables and configuration files.
